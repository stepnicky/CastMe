# CastMe
CastMe is a web application that facilitates the process of organizing the casting.
## Features
* As a casting director you can add new casting and to that casting you can add roles which you want to cast with optional file attachments (with script, scene or monologue)
* After the role has been added, every actor that meets the role requirements is automatically invited to take part in the casting
* Actors may give likes to the roles they're being considered to
* As an actor you can send links (to youtube, wetransfer etc.) with your recorded selftape for casting director's eyes only
* As an actor you can add photos to your official profile
* As a casting director you get a notification whenever an actor likes a role or sends her/his selftape link
* As an actor you get a notification everytime I'm invited to take part in casting
